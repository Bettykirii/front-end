    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
    We sell all types of books. We also follow up on our customers to ensure that they read their books and not just keep them parking in the house.<br>
    We also have a book club that meets on weekends and people read together. This helps the readers that finds it boring to read alone. <br>
    We also have a well trained team that helps kids to develop a reading culture as early as a few years old.
